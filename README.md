# (7, 4) cyclic encoder in VHDL
- This is a (7, 4) Cyclic Encoder using a Linear Feedback Shift Register in VHDL. Output is produced on the 5th clock cycle, after 4 shifts.
- Code copied from [my answer](https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/536273/238188) on the Electrical Engineering Stack Exchange.
- design.vhd contains the VHDL design file and testbench.vhd contains a simple VHDL testbench.
- Here is a [live demonstration](https://edaplayground.com/x/s5EU) of the project on EDA Playground.
- To do: Cyclic Decoder in VHDL. Make the design parameterisable.
